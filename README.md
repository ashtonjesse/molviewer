## ðŸ”© Core module

The base logic is handled by the [`molecules`](https://github.com/ashtonjesse/molviewer/blob/master/src/molviewer/molecules.py)
module. It implements two classes `Macromolecule` and `ChemicalMolecule`, 
which retrieve molecular data from the [rcsb](https://www.rcsb.org) and 
[ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) databases, respectively. The 
package is intended to be used in a Jupyter Notebook. Users can create class
instances by specifying either a protein data bank id (for `Macromolecule`) 
or a chembl id (for `ChemicalMolecule`). 
Both 
classes expose a `show` method for displaying 3D molecule models in a 
Jupyter Notebook and a `save` method for saving molecule data to file. 
`Macromolecule` models are generated using methods available in the 
[`nglview`](https://github.com/nglviewer/nglview) Python package, 
whereas 3D conformers are generated for the `ChemicalMolecule` class using 
methods available in the [`rdkit`](https://www.rdkit.org/) Python package. 

## âš¡ Quickstart instructions (for Windows)

Create a virtual environment and activate it using the 
following command in the terminal:
```python
.\Scripts\activate
```
If loading scripts is disabled then first run this command in the terminal:
```python
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
```
Then install the `molviewer` package:
```python
py -m pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/pypi/ --extra-index-url 
https://pypi.org/simple molviewer==0.0.13
```
Run `Jupyter` with the following command:
```python
jupyter notebook
```
Create a new `notebook` and import the `molviewer` package:
```python
from molviewer.molecules import ChemicalMolecule, Macromolecule
```
